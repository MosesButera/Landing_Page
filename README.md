# Landing_Page

In this project I will recreate an entire web page from a design provided by the Odinproject. See Odinproject design here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page
I will use what i've learned in all the previous chapters from the beginning of Odinproject foundations course to flexbox, to recreate the design provided. See OdinProject list from beggining - flexbox: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations
